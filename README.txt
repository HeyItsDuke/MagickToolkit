To use the scripts, place the paths of your input folder and your output folder into "paths.txt" so the scripts can read them. Then click them to run.

"convert_png" will simply convert any non-PNG files to PNG format without resizing them. Same with the two WebP conversion scripts.

Is this the most optimal way to go about this? I don't know. But it was fun to make and is useful for my needs.
